# WEB-RI
This repository is for the WEB-RI project. 

The WEB-RI is a web interface that allows the users to interact with the functionalities provided by the SDK-RI. It can be reused and customized as part of each pilot specification and implementation needs.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
This project is divided into different directories:
- components: contains all visual elements that can be reused in all pages.
- lib: contains information such forms, colors, user and server configuration.
- pages: each file represents a React component with associated route based on its file name.
- public: contains files such images and logos.
- styles: responsible to customize the design of the website. 

## Installation
```bash
npm install
```

## Run
```bash
[ENDPOINT] [USERNAME] [PASSWORD] npm run dev

# ENDPOINT: pilot endpoint (http://12.345.6.789:1234 example)
# USERNAME: i3-MARKET login username
# PASSWORD: i3-MARKET login password
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages. Some of the API routes correspond to full pages, while some only return the contents of specific components.

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.


### Lint with auto-fix
Run the following command to auto-fix some eslint warnings:
```sh
make lint
```

### Tags
For editors that support tags, you can run the following command to create the ./tags file.

```sh
make tags
```

### Editor settings
The project uses 4 spaces for indentation, and although this is auto-fixable,
we recommend that you set this preference in your editor settings, in case
it uses different values by default.

If you would like to use Vim, add the following to your .vimrc so that
.vimrc.local in the project directory is automatically sourced.

```
autocmd VimEnter * if filereadable('.vimrc.local')
			\ && 1 == confirm('.vimrc.local is present. Source?', "&Yes\n&No", 0)
			\ | source .vimrc.local
```
